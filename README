xDoc is a documentation tool for haXe code.

Differences with other haXe documentation tools:

- Classpath based: pass your classpath(s) to xDoc and it will output your documentation. haxedoc.xml file is created (almost) automatically.
- Template based: the output of xDoc should be easily modifiable using haXe templates and custom files (css, js, etc).
- Output agnostic: currently xDoc outputs html files but it will at least facilitate other outputs such as PDF or CHM.

** IMPORTANT **

xDoc is at the moment no more than a proof of concept. I mean to keep working on it, but I'm not sure it will ever make it to a full release.

You can use other tools such as haxedoc or ChxDoc for the time being, they are very good and much more mature.
